The following Haskell code attempts to use the `maximum` function on an empty list, leading to a runtime exception:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let emptyList = []
  let maxVal = maximum emptyList
  print maxVal
```

This will result in a runtime error because `maximum` is not defined for empty lists.
